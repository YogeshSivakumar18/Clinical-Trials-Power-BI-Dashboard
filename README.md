# Clinical Trials Intelligence Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard visualizes global clinical trial data with insights into trial phases, company contributions, enrollment patterns, and disease focus areas.
This project uses a cleaned and transformed dataset containing historical clinical trial records contributed by pharmaceutical companies (e.g., Sanofi, GSK, Merck, Pfizer, etc.). The dataset contains over 13,000 clinical trial records, spanning multiple therapeutic areas and sponsors.

## Key Features

- Breakdown by trial phase and year
- Sponsor contribution via treemap
