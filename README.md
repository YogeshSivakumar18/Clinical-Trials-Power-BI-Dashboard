# Clinical Trials Intelligence Dashboard

## Problem Statment:
"Pharmaceutical companies and research organizations struggle to monitor and analyze large volumes of clinical trial data scattered across multiple phases, sponsors, conditions, and timelines. This lack of visibility hampers strategic decision-making in R&D prioritization, resource allocation, and performance benchmarking."

This Power BI dashboard visualizes global clinical trial data with insights into trial phases, company contributions, enrollment patterns, and disease focus areas.
This project uses a cleaned and transformed dataset containing historical clinical trial records contributed by pharmaceutical companies (e.g., Sanofi, GSK, Merck, Pfizer, etc.). The dataset contains over 13,000 clinical trial records, spanning multiple therapeutic areas and sponsors.

## Key Features
- Total trials, average enrollment, completion %
- Breakdown by trial phase and year
- Sponsor contribution via treemap
- Top 10 studied conditions
- Dynamic KPIs

The dashboard is styled with a clean clinical look, soft blues, modern fonts, and responsive layout, which makes it not only insightful but presentation-ready for stakeholders.
